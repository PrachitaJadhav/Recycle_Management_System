#♻️ Recycle Management System

The process of recycling waste materials by connecting individual users with companies that require recyclable resources. The system enables users to scan and list recyclable items, add them to a cart, and schedule pickups with interested companies based on the material type (e.g., plastic, metal, glass, paper, e-waste, etc.).
